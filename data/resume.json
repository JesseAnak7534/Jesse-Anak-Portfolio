I have worked with diverse datasets to clean, validate, analyze, and interpret data using tools such as SQL, Excel, R, Python, SPSS, STATA, Power BI, and Tableau, supporting evidence-based decision-making and performance tracking. Through roles as a research assistant and project statistician, I have prepared analytical reports, monitored data quality and key indicators, and translated complex findings into clear, actionable insights for multidisciplinary stakeholders. I bring strong analytical thinking, attention to detail, and the ability to communicate insights effectively, and I am eager to grow as a junior data analyst in a collaborative, remote environment.",
